Deep Video Analytics is a platform for indexing and extracting information from videos and images.
It uses Deep learning detection and recognition algorithms for indexing individual frames/images along with 
detected objects. Deep Video analytics aims to become a quickly customizable platform for developing 
visual & video analytics applications, while benefiting from seamless integration with state or the art models & datasets
released by the vision research community.
