Deep Video Analytics provides a platform for indexing and extracting information from videos and images.
Deep learning detection and recognition algorithms are used for indexing individual frames/images along with 
detected objects. The goal of Deep Video analytics is to become a quickly customizable platform for developing 
visual & video analytics applications, while benefiting from seamless integration with state or the art models & datasets
released by the vision research community. 

**We take significant efforts to ensure that following models (code+weights included) work without having to write any code.**

- [x] Indexing using Google inception V3 trained on Imagenet
- [x] [Single Shot Detector (SSD) Multibox 300 training using VOC](https://github.com/balancap/SSD-Tensorflow)  
- [x] Alexnet using Pytorch  (disabled by default; set ALEX_ENABLE=1 in environment variable to use)
- [x] [YOLO 9000](http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) (disabled by default; set YOLO_ENABLE=1 in environment variable to use)
- [x] [Face detection/alignment/recognition using MTCNN and Facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet)

Please contact me for more information, I plan on relaxing the license soon, once a beta version is reached 
(To the extent allowed by the code/models included.e.g. FAISS disallows commercial use.).
