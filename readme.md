# Deep Video Analytics  â€¢  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AKSHAYUBHAT/DeepVideoAnalytics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AKSHAYUBHAT/DeepVideoAnalytics)

![Banner](notes/banner_small.png "banner")

**Don't be worried by complexity of this banner, with latest version of docker installed correctly, you can run Deep Video Analytics in minutes locally (even without a GPU) using a single command.**
