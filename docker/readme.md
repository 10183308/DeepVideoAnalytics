### Docker installation for use with nvidia-docker

Please install https://github.com/eywalker/nvidia-docker-compose and replace 'docker-compose with nvidia-docker-compose in all commands.

E.g. to launch the stack just run 
````bash
./rebuild_gpu.sh && nvidia-docker-compose -f docker-compose-gpu.yml up
````
Open port 8000 on localhost once the server is up.
Typically you will have to wait couple of minutes for all containers to be ready and django migrations to be applied.
